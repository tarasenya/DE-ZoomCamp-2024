Module 1 Homework
Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment and practice with Docker and SQL

Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker

docker --help

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

docker build --help

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - Automatically remove the container when it exits

    --delete
    --rc
    --rmc
    --rm <--- this

Question 2. Understanding docker first run

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash. Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list ).

What is version of the package wheel ?

    0.42.0 <--- this
    1.0.0
    23.0.1
    58.1.0

Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz

You will also need the dataset with zones:

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)

Question 3. Count records

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18.

Remember that lpep_pickup_datetime and lpep_dropoff_datetime columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

    15767
    15612 <--- this
    15859
    89009

Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance Use the pick up time for your calculations.

    2019-09-18
    2019-09-16
    2019-09-26 <--- this
    2019-09-21

Question 5. The number of passengers

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?

    "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens" <--- this
    "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
    "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens"
    "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"

Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's tip , not trip

    Central Park
    Jamaica
    JFK Airport <--- this
    Long Island City/Queens Plaza

Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo here to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.
Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

terraform apply
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "demo_dataset"

      + force_destroy               = true

      + public_access_prevention    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + terraform_labels            = (known after apply)
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
            }
          + condition {
              + age                   = 1
              + matches_prefix        = []
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + matches_suffix        = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
